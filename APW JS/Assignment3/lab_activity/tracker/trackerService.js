Improved Tracker Functionality.
In this lab, I've added the ability for the tracker to emit an event when
a new exercise is set.  In a fully-featured application we could respond to
this event in a variety of ways. For now we are just going to re-

Input:  Exercise type

//this is an old way of "inheriting" from event emitter

//There's even yet one more way to inherit using the 'util'
//module and util.inherits method.  We won't cover that because
//it was transitional (ES6 Classes are recommended now and prototyping is
//what was used in the majority of old libraries you'll see)
